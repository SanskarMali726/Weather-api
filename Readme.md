# 🌦️ Weather API

This project is a simple **Weather API** built in Go that fetches real-time weather data from a third-party API, processes it, and returns the results in a clean JSON format.  
It also demonstrates how to work with **external APIs, environment variables, and caching**.

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches real-time weather data from a 3rd party API  
- Provides a REST API endpoint for clients to request weather data  
- Supports JSON responses  
- Simple caching layer to reduce unnecessary API calls

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Go (Golang)** – Backend server  
- **Chi Router** – For building REST endpoints  
- **Third-party Weather API** (like [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) or [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api))
